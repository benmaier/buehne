# Buehne

Atmospheric track made in Sonic Pi (http://sonic-pi.net). As a challenge this track was only composed of samples.

Samples included free drum kits and chord kits from http://soundpacks.com as well as part of an old German audio play.

Check out the [live recording on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1CBXRFwuovM) and [my Soundcloud](soundcloud.com/pakd-1/buhne).
